The lakes Vassijaure and Tornetr'ask being situated at
about 68 ¹„s30 lat. and near the 1100 1111111, and having a compa-
ratively low average temperature on account 01 1110 perpetual
5110117 and glaciers on the surrounding Alps, Ι had expected to
find the hymenomycetal flora of that region very scanty. To
my surprise, however, it was found to be rather the reverse.
Not only the whole birch—zone but also the region above 1110
1100 1111111 right up 10 1110 perpetual snow abounded with fungi.
Ι 1111151 add, however, that this is true only with regard 10 my
11151 171511 (1909); the next year (1910) the fleshy fungi were
rather 500100, and thus Ι learned that the frequency 01 111050
fungi here as elsewhere depends very much on the quantity 01
10111 falling in due time. The year 1910 was abnormal in being
more than usually dry during the greater part 01 1110 51111111101.

801110 01 1110 genera were comparatively less represented
than others. 80 101 instance Ι saw but one species of Amanita
(vayinata)¹, two 01 Lepiota (qranulosa and amianthvjna) one 01
Α rwm'llarz'a (mellea), five 01 Tricholoma (albumz qrammopodium³‚

 

¹ Several varieties: white or whitish, livid, melleo-ochraceous. common
even above the tree limit, especially the whitish or livid variety.

2 At Bjorkliden and the adjacent side of Nuolja. — Just the species
illustrated in FRIEs' Ic. sel. t. 43. fig. 1, 10 which Trich. stiparophyllum and
Trich. raphaninum seem to be synonyms. The spores are ovate or nearly oval,
often oblique and l-guttate, 6-7 >< 4-41]2 μ.

³ Of this species Ι saw a white variety at Palnoviken. — Such a variety
is found on several places in Sweden, for instance Norrbo in Helsingland,
smel-thohu, Rydbo in Upland (HAMNER)‚ Lidingo (T6RNGREN). Ljustero',
Danderyd and Salem (G. ROMELL) in S&dermanland‚ Bedarb· (SANDEBERG),
Odeshog in ‹''›ste1·g6tland and Hjo in Vastergotland (C. T6RNGREN). In
Monogr. I p. 93 FmEs mentions the occurrence of a »varietas omnino alba»
of Trich. qrammopodiwm, and it may be supposed that he alludes to this plant.
lt is, however, not hygrophanous and as it seems 10 be constantly distinct
and easily recognisable, I think it would be suitable and convenient 10 110170
a separate name for it. In my notes and in the herbarium Ι have suggested
the name Tr. pub'ijol'ium,alluding to the projecting eystidia (50—100>< 12—16 μ,
obtusely subfusiform, ventricose ete.) which render both sides of the gills
quite velutinous under the lens, at least in the young state — a character
which belongs also 10 the allied species. —— The habit reminds one 01 Clitocybe
tornata in FRIEs' Ic. sel. t. 51. f. l. and of Trich. cnista BRES. Fung. Trid. Ι t. 48
and Fungh, inaug. t. 31, but it can hardly be Trich. cnista (misspelling for
vnissaY) either of ans or of BRESADOLA. as the smel] is neither that of roasted
flos-h nor mealy, but rather »mueidusm

Though generally slender (stem 6—10><¹s·.›—1¹l2 cm.)‚ thinner and
511101101- (pileus 4—9 0111. broad), often umbonate and not allied to Trich. qam-
