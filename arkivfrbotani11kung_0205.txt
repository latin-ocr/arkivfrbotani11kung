L. Romnum, HYMENOMYCETES OF LAPPLAND. 23

swear by all authentic specimens and that we. should accept.
those only which agree with thc published descriptions. If
both names (molluscus and Vetillantii) are to be saved, I think
that the first should be applied to Pol. hymenocystas and thc
second to BREsADOLA's Poma mollum.

What F RIEs called the present species I do not know. In
his herbarium therc is a specimen from Dalarne named »P0l.
mucidus ›> which probably belongs here. But several collection>-
in BLYTT'S herbarium which FRIES has referred to Pol. mucida-3
(though some seem to belong to Pol. cor-ticola, others to Pol.
bombycinus etc.) show that it is impossible to tell from the
authentic specimens what Pol. mucidus of F RIES really is. And as
none of all these seems to agree with PERsooN⁷s specimens of Pol.
711 acidus, I think it unadvisable to use that name for the present
plant which besides does not agree well with the descriptions.

This plant should probably be considered as the true and
original Pol. stereoides of FR1Es. The name is well adapted
as the habit very much resembles a Steremn. It agrees exactly
with a specimen from Femsjo in the herb. of FRIES so named.
The label is written by ROB. FRIEs, and ELIAS FRIEs probably
suggested the name or at least approved it, so that the specimen
can be held authentic. If this specimen were the only one, the
question might be considered settled in spite of the statement
»ad truncos abiegnos ›> which may be correct, though more pro-
bably is a mistake since nobody else, so far as I know, has found
this plant on conifers but only on deciduous trees. There is
however, also another authentic specimen (with a label written
by EL. FRIES himself) but this belongs to Pol. cervinus PERS.
(Doeclalea mollis 8011111, Trametes mollis Ἐκ), a species which
