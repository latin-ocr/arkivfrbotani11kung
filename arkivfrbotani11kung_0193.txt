L. ROMELL, HYMENOMYCETES OF LAPPLAND. ll

P. albolutescens n. sp.

Resupinatus, mollis, albo-crocco-lutescens, separabilis, l—
2 mm. crassus, dorso luteo, margine byssino, fimbriato albo vel
lutescente. Pori albo—lutescentes, 3-—4 vel 2-4 per mm., de-
mum inaequales. Hyphae molles, fibulatae‚ 2—3—-4 μ latae.
Basidia 4-spora‚ clavata, 15—20 ><4 {fig—6 μ. Sterigmata
3-8μ longa. Sporae globoso-ellipsoideae 1*οΙ globoso-ovatae
3—5 ><2¹x'2-4 μ.

On rotten wood 01 Abies at Lakatrask.

A specimen collected at Rydbo near Stockholm differs in
having the margin almost arachnoid, more white and not fim-
briate, the back-side more white, the hyphae collapsed, irregular
and broader (3—(3 μ, 50100 00115 even inflate up to 9 μ), the
basidia sometimes cylindric (12 ><6—7 μ) with a clavate or
obovate basis (15><12 μ) and the spores globose‚ 5—7 μ diam.
— This might belong to a distinct species, but is probably clo-
sely allied.

The authentic specimen 01 Trechisporcz onusta KARST. seems
to contain two species, viZ. Pol. hymenocystz's B. & BR. and the.
species above described. As KARSTEN refers his plant to a
separate genus with echinulatc spores‚ which occur in P. hy-
menocystc's only, I think it unadvisable to apply his name »onus-
tns» to the present species.

The specimen from Rydbo might belong to Poria onusta
BRES. Fungi Gall. p. 41, though the basidia are there described
as »subglobose›> which the)⁷ are not in my specimen, at least
not in the ripe state. Ι have seen some subglobose top-cells
(about 9 μ broad) in the specimen from Rydbo, but whether
they are cystidia or the basis on which a cylindric basidium is
formed later, I have not had time to ascertain. In the specimen
from Lakatriisk I do not find such top-cells. Both specimens
have typical subulate sterigmata.

P. benzoinus.

On a stub 01 Pinus silvestris at Kalixfors and on Abies at
Nattavara.

Spores hyaline, allantoid or runner-shaped 5—5) ><2—3
μ (10 specimens from Stockholm ).

P. betulinus.
On dead trunks 01 Betula at Stordalen.
