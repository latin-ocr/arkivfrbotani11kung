L. ROMELL, HYMENOMYCETES OF LAPPLAND. 3

1111111ίί04, multiforme⁵‚ rutilans-⁶), three of Pleni-otus (ulium-ius&
conchanis& 'serotinus-²⁹), none of Psalliota, none of H yqrophoru-s¹‘'‚

the sunburnt state sometimes varying· into pallid or creamy, as Rep. 325.
The gills are white and crowded. The spores are white. ellipsoidal. grumous
or l-guttate‚ spuriously asperulate, 9—12 >< 5-6 μ, while the spores of Trich.
gambosum are small. 4 ¹l2—(3 >< 3 μ (not as stated by some english authors).

⁴ At Abisko and Bjiirkliden. I 3111 not quite sure. whether the speci· ,
1116113 Ι found do really belong to Tricholoma humile, though LINDBLAD many
years ago referred thither similar forms found at Stockholm. The form Ι
1116311 differs both from PERSOON's and from ans' description in several
respects and especially in the gill color. which at last becomes dirty 1601011311,
almost as Rep. 308 a, thcreby reminding of Pluteus It is no doubt allied to
Trich. humile. Trich. gyrarvi-mopodz'zcmv Trich. melaleucum, Tr. arcuatum and
Tr. brevipes, having about the same spores and cystidia, but the limit of Trz'ch.
humile FR. is still unclear to me and seems to be rather vague.

⁵ This species was found along the railway only, but here it quite fre-
quently grew in clusters, especially in the neighbourhood of the scientific
station. where this plant and Naucorz'a myosotis probably were the most abun-
dant fungi in 1909. It was noticed also at several railway stations, for in-
stance Elfsbyn, Mellansel, 8613100, cn my return the same year. In 1910 Ι
scarcely saw it at all except a small cluster at Riksgr'ansen. At first Ι supposed
this plant to be identical with one occurring at Stockholm which has been
referred to Trzssch. tumulosum and which has globose spores (5-6-’7 μ diam. ),
just as Tricholoma conglobatum (as understood by BRESADOLA in Fungi Trid.
Ι. p. 27) and Clitocybe decastes (as understood by 1οΝ POST) and Clz'tocybe
famosa etc. But the lapponian species, though apparently allied to all these,
differs in having ellipsoidal spores (7-—8 >< 4-5 μ), and as it seems to agree
tolerably 111 11113 respect with Tricholoma pes caproe yar. multiformis (as under-
stood by ΜΑ33ΕΥ 111 ΟΟΟΚΕ, Illustr. t. 946), I have named it Trich. multiforme.
whether it is quite identicaL however, either with MASSEY's or with SCHAEFFER⁷S
plant of that name Ι am unable at present to decide. At all events Ι would
object to eall it »pes caproe», as it has no more likeness to the feet of a goat
than to the moon or anything else. — The color of my plant is much darker
than MASSEY'S illustration, and the margin of the pileus 13 sometimes channelled
as in Paxillus involutus.. The diameter varies say from l—lO cm.

As this species seemed to be confined to the immediate neighbourhood
of the railway, one might suspect that its distribution to these regions should
be due to the more frequent communications and transport of material and
animals connected with the railway. The same might possibly be said of
C'lt'tocybe opaca (probably not distinct from (vit. cerussata). which grew at
Katterjokk in a place. which served as 3 stable for horses during the construc-
tion of the railway, and of Volvaria speciosa. which was found growing on rich
soil at Stenbacken and Tornetrask stations.

⁶ Only at Kalixfors.
, ⁷ On Belula at Bjiirkliden, Kopparasen and Piilnoviken. — The spores
seem to vary from globose (4-5 21.dian1.)to ellipsoidal-globose (5—7><4—5 μ).

⁸ On Betula at Tornetrask station, Bergfors and Kalixfors. — Spores
subcylindrical‚ 9—12 >< 4 μ. Τ1113 plant occurs also at Stoekholm, sometimes
quite abundantly, on trunks of BetuZa and Sorbus, more seldom on Salian
1 am not quite sure that it is identical with BULL. t. 298 and 517 O P. neither
do Ι know what FRIES called it. From his statement that Pleur. pulmo'narius
grows on Betula and Sorbus one might suspect that my plant belongs to that
species. It differs, however, both from FRIEs' Icon. t. 87. f. ·2 and from his
description (the pileus being exeentric and not »exacte lateralis »). At any
rate my plant has nothing to do with Partus torulosus, to which Fmsss considers
his P. comhatus »nimis affinis». It is also eagerly eaten by vermin, which,
according to ans, Partus conchatus should not be.

⁹ At Bjiirkliden etc. Spores allantoid, small. 4¹1='-.›—(3><¹l-2—1 μ..

¹⁰ Unless we refer thither, as KARSTEN did one time. Clitocybe luccam,
of which I collected at Tornetrask station not only the common form with
