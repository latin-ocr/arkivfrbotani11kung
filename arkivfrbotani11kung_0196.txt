BRESADOLA’S Poria subtilis· seems to be identical, and
SCHRADER'S plant with that name, which FRIEs refers to Poro-
tlzelz'um, might belong here, though this question can not be
definitely settled without studying SCHRADER'S specimen.
Whether this is still existing Ι (10 not know. At all events my
plant is quite identical with a collection from CHAILLET in
PERsoon’s herbarium, determincd by PERSOON as »Bor byssi-
nus SCIIRAD. Boletus molluscus Syn. Fung.» This last name
›>molluscus›> could be accepted as very apt indeed, but in fact
both PERSOON and FRIES have referred different things to Pol.
molius-cus, and BRESADOLA’S »Porz'a mollusca » is another species.
I therefore use here the name given by BERKELEY and BROOME,
though in my opinion not very apt, but founded on a specimen
still existing in BERKELEY’S herbarium.

In specimens collected in F emsjo (for instance LLOYD
09203 and 09206) 1110 hyphae are a little broader (2—4—-6 μ
or some cells even up to 10—20 μ broad) and often sprinkled
with crystals and small granules. The spores are also a little
larger (3—5><3——3 ¹s2 μ), subglobose or ellipsoidal or even
subreniform.

whole birch region. At Abisko some small specimens were
found also on Populus (the hanging variety common on this
host).

¹ In a single specimen on Sabim from Nuolja (marked 9.8.09: 20 Ε) Ι fail
to find any hymenial spines. Else such spines seem to be a constant character
in this species, though smne authors doubt or deny their existence. I have
cxamined a lot of specirnens in this respect from Salix, Sorbus, Pyrus Malus,
Populus, Alnus, Rerum, Corybas, Acer etc. and in all (with the only exception
just stated) I found the spinos not only existing but even rather abundant.
They are, however, generally not uniformly distributed over the whole inner

the mouth. For facilitating their (letcction it is advisable, therefore, 1ο make
