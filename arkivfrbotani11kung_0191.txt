L. ROMELL, HYMENOMYCETES OF LAPPLAND. 9

For the opportunity 01 comparing authentic spec-iniens 01
PERSOON. FmEs, SOMMERFELT„ BERKELEY and KARSTEN Ι am
indebted to the Curators 01 the herbaria 01 these authors.

Boletus.

Of this genus I saw four species only: chrysenteron, rusus,
eseber and varieqcctus.

B. chrysanteron.

Noted only from Pessijokk, where two specimens were found.

B. rufus.

At Kalixfors, where this species was common, I noticed
that the ssesh, when exposed to the air, turns reddish, sometimes
with a lilac or violaceous tint, after 1-—5 minutes. In specimens
01 Β. scaber Ι could not trace such a staining even after an hour,
and I therefore cannot but agree with Qmmr, when he refers
FRIES’ Sv. Atl. Sv. t. 14 to this species rather than to Β. scaber.
I must add, however, that both this and other characters dis-
appear with age so that old specimens are often difficult to dis-
tinguish. — That SCHAEFFER’S t. 103 belongs here, as FRIEs
and others presume‚ can scarcely be doubted. SCHAEFFER’S
wrong drawing of the spores must of course not be taken account
01 ; nearly all his spore drawings are wrong2 the optical means
01 that time being insufficienti for the purpose.

B. scaber.

This species occurred everywhere, also above the tree limit.
As all common species it varied in color, habit and size. At
Palnoviken Ι saw a variety with exaetly the same brown color
as that 01 Boletus edulis. Both there and at J ebrenjokk occured
another variety with scaly pileus much reminding 01 Psalliota
anquam. thether this latter variety really belongs here or 10
Β. rusus I did not make out, however.

B. variegatus.

At Tornetrask and Kalixfors.
