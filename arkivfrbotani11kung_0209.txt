L. ROMELL, HYMENOMYCETES oF LAPPLAND. 27

Three of these are hitherto undescribed as far as I know. — M .
jusisporus was not collected by me, but is found at Umea and
might possibly occur also in Lappland.

M. borealis n. sp. —— Fig. 15.

Resupinatus«, mollis, laxe adhaerens, longissime expansusv
(pedalis et ultra) primitus albim, interdum cum tinctura levis-
sima rosea vel incarnata, dein cremeus vel ochroleucus, margine
radioso albo. Hymenium primitus tenerrimum. laeve, glabrum,
corticioideum, dein merulioideowugosum, demum rimosum,
subiculo albo, molli, tomentoso in rimis visibili. Hyphae
molles, fibulato-septatae, 3—5 μ latae. Sporae lineari-oblongae,
oblique apiculatae, 6——8><2 μ.

On rotten trunks of Betula ab Palnoviken and Kalixfors
and on a rotten trunk of Pinus silv. at Nattavara. — Besides in
Lappland I collected this species at Lakatrask and Jorn (ou
Pinus silv.) and at Selsjon (on Betula). It seems thus to be
widely distributed in North Sweden. As far as Ι know it is
not found in other parts of the country, unless a collection from
F loda in Vastergbtland (on bark of Abies) may be considered
as a var. isabellam of iti. This collection is referred to Mer.
porinoides in ROB. FRIES’ Addit. p. 35, but can probably not
be accepted under that name, as it does not agree with authen-
tic specimens of M. porinoides FR.

Among the mostly unpublislled colored drawings of fungi
made under FRIEs’ inspection and deposited in The Royal Aca-
demie of Science at Stoekholm, there is one showing a ›fflIerulc'ns
juyczx» from Torne Lappmark, collected (probably by C. P.
LAESTADIUS) on the bark of Populus tremula. This looks rather
like my ΠΙ. borealis, but whether identical, Ι cannot ascertain.
as no specimens of it are found in F RIEs’ herbarium. At! all
events, it can not be identical with the authentic specimen of
flIer. fuglam, which has proved to be young M. moll usca-s.

M. fusisporus n. sp.

Resupinatus, albidus. subiculo tenui, laxo, molli, sericeo-
filamentoso. Hymenium membranaceum, reticulato-plicatum.
Hyphae subiculi 1 {sss—3 μ latae, partim liberae, partim in fila
8-60 μ lata coalitae. Basidia 27><6—7 μ. Sporae subfusoi-
deae, 7 ¹g‘2—l2 >< 3-—4 ¹ -.· μ..
