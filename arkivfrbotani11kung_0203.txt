L. ROMELL, HYMENOMYCETES or LAPPLAND. 21

Resupinatus, adnatus, l—2 mm. crassus, margine byssino
vel nudo, albus, pallescens, dein subfulvescens, in statu sicco
1·igido—fragiliS‚ demum quasi glutinescens et tum in statu sicco
rimosus et quoad colorem et consistentiam quasi sordide resi-
naceus.

Pori inaequales, angulati, 3 vel 2—4 per mm.‚ vulgo obliqui.
Hyphae fibulato-septatae, tenues, 2 vel 2—:3 μ latae. Basidia
15-—20 ><4—5 μ. Sporae oblique oblongae, 4—5(—7) ><2-21“3
(—3) μ·

This species, which is collected also at Stockholm (on dead
trunks of Salix in a hedge)‚ I first supposed to be the true
Polyp. anem-enus SOMM. Authentic specimens show, however,
that the latter is identical with Pol. serenus K. (both having
bro-ader spores, 5-6 ><3—4 μ) and consequently distinct both
from my plant and from F RIEs’ Pol. aneirinus, which is identical
with Pol. cortz'cola according to specimens in FRIES’ herbarium.

Though the hyphae of many fungi, especially when old
and exposed to continual moistme, are liable to be reduced into
a more or less conglutinate state so as to render the plant or a
part of it like resin or horn when dried, I think that the present
species shows this character in a more conspicuous manner, so
that the name may be considered reasonable. At all events,
] was not able to invent any better (the occurrence on Salia: at
Stoekholm forbidding the use of a> name indicating the host or
the northern habitat).

P. reticulatus, -— Fig. 10.

On rotten trunks of Betula, Salia· and Sorbus at Bjorkliden,
N uolja, Palnoviken and Kalixfors.

Pores 2—4 per mm. Spores allantoid, 7—9 ><2—3 μ.
Hyphae fragile, not fibulate, 4—5 μ broad. — The young pores
are distant, forming shallow cups in the cobwebby subiculuni
so that the plant in this state might be referred to Porothelium3
soon, however, the cups expand and grow together so as to form
a continuous hymenium.

The color is generally white, but changes sometimes into
yellowish as in P. expallescens var. slavidulus K, Which in my
opinion is a synonym, it having the same macro· and micro-
scopic characters. Also the authentic specimen of P. sarinellue
in the Kew herbarium belongs here,
