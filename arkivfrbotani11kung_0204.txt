ARKIV Fon BoTANIK. BAND ll. N:o 3.

P. sericeo-mollis n. sp. — Fig. 7.

Albus, mollis, immo mollissimus, 1—3 mm. crassus, resu-
pinatus, laxe adhaerens, margine saepe secedens, sed vix reflexus
licet in statu sicco interdum incurvus. Hymenium album vel
demum aliquando cremeo-pallidum. Pori vulgo angulati, in
spec. lapp. circ. 3 per mm., in ceteris varii. Hyphae fibulato-
septatae, 2—4 μ latae. Basidia 4-spora, 20 ><5 μ. Sporae
ellipsoideae, 4—ss ><2—3 μ.

On rotten coniferous wood at Nattavara. — Found also
at Umea (by VLEUGEL) and in several places at Stockholm.

Some specimens which seem to belong to this plant are
partly or totally reduced into a floccose-pulveraceous state of
sulphurous or pallid color, which contains abundant subglobose
or ellipsoidaL apparently asperulate, l-guttate chlamydospores
of 5—7 ¹f'2><4—5 μ, not unlike those of Ptychoqaster albus,
though more hya-line.

At Femsjo I have met with a variety (or perhaps distinct
species1) with hanging cucullate pilei of about l—-4 cm. diam„
growing on a dead trunk of Abies between the loose bark and
the wood and having about the same basidiospores but the
hymenium darker or as it were sordid, at least in the dried state,
and associate with this variety grew a fibrous-pulveraceous
Ptychoqaster of about isabelline color, still more like small
specimens of Ptychoqaster albu&

Both the variety and the typica] form belong probably
to the form series named Pol. Vaillantz‘i in MEZ, Der Haus-
schwamni, p. 93. Ι (10 not think, however, that either of them
is the true Pol. Vaz'llantii of FRIEs. I know but one plant which
agrees well with FRIEs’ description of that species and this is
the one which BRESADOLA calls Poria mollusca. That this is
really identical with Fssms’ Pol. Vaillantii seems to be confirmed
also by a collection in BLYTT'S herbarium which was so deter-
mined by BLYTT and approved by FRIES. The fact that a spe-
cimen of the same plant in FRIEs’ herbarium (Upl. Halmbyboda
1853) is named Pol. onolluscus (though not in ELIAS FRIES’
own handwriting) seems to contradict this opinion. Taking
into consideration, however, that specimens in BLYTT’S herba-
rium named or approved by FRIES as »P0l. molluscus» belong
the one to Pol. lzymenocystis B. δι BR. and the other to Poria
cineres-cens· Bsssss„ we must admit that it would bc absurd to
