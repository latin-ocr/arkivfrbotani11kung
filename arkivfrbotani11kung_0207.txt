L. ROMELL, HYMENOMYOETES OF LAPPLAND. 25

margin grayish. Pores 4-—6 per mm. Spores allantoid, 3¹ 2—
5>< 1ω-1112 μ. Hyphac as in P. lacteus intricate, 3—6(—9) μ. broad.

P. vaporat-ius ΕΒ.

011 charred trunks of Pinus silvestris at Nattavara.

Pores 2—3(—4) per mm. Spores allant.. 6>< 1¹x'3—-2 μ (111
spec. from Femsjo).

The specimen collected was too dry and old to get spores
from. In the allied Pol. sinuo-sus the spores are allantoid (though
not strongly curved) 5—7(—9) ><1—2 μ. FRIES' Io. t. 190
fig. 1 is not like either of those but might be the resupinate form
of Lenzites heteromorpha, —— Pol. υαρονανὶῑιὸἸ as understood in
England is another species, viz. Pol. versiporus PERS.

Ρ. velutinus.

On trunks of Betula at Tornetrask‚ Bergfors and Kalixfors.
Pores 3-—5 per mm. Spores subcylindric, 6—8 ><2 μ.

Ρ. vulgaris. -—— Fig. 12.

On rotten wood of Salia: and Betula at Jebrenjokk and
Abisko and on wood of Pinus silveatris at Kalixfors.

The pores are more or less sulphurous at least within. Po-
res about 4—-5 per mm. with rather thick partitions. The hy-
menial hyphae firm, undulate, not fibulate, 2—4 μ, broad.
Spores allantoid‚ 4—6 ><1 ¹1s4—Ff‘2 μ.

As I had hitherto collected this sulphurous variety but on
pine, I was surprised now to find it growing also on deciduous
trees.

This is probany the variety calcea FR. as understood in
Epicr. and Hym. Eur.5 but in Syst. Myc. the name is restricted
to the form with »poris hiantibus ›>.

P. slavus K. and P. selectus K. are probany synonyms⁷
but P. flavicans K. is a more soft and fragile species, with tender
fibulate hyphae and generally irregular, lacerated pores.

P. zonatus.

On trunks of Betulct at Njutum, Abisko, Stordalen, Torne-
tras-k, Bergfors and Kalixfors, at Abisko also 011 Populus.

Pores about 3 or 3——4 per mm. Spores cylindrieally oblong
oblique, apicfflate, 6—9 ><3 μ.

If I am not mistaken, the authentic specimen of Pol. me-
dulla panis FRIES in the Upsala herbarium is only the resupi-
