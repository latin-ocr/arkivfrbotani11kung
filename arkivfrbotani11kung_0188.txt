to 00010 11111101 the notice of other people than botanists I think such a mode
of systematization is the more needful.

²⁵ Only at Pessijokk.

²ss At Tornetr'ask.

²⁷ At Bjorkliden.

²8 At Tornetr'ask and Kalixfors. — This species is named byLINDBLAD
and was published in his »Svampbok» (1901). It is allied to R. inteqra and
R. decolorans, differing from the former in having paler eolored gills and
spore powder and being acrid at least in the young state, from the latter in
not becoming grayish, and from both in having the stem generally somewhat
reddish. The color of the pileus varies but comes often near to COOKE t.
998 (1026) and 1049 (1097) or a mixture of both. — MA1RE considers this spe-
0103 identical with R. paludosa BRITZ. (300 Β1111., Soc. Myc. de France Tome
XXVI . 65).

²9 pAt szzrkliden. Tornetrask and Kalixfors. — In Obs. Myc. Ι referred
this species with some doubt to Russ. constans BRITZ. Ι have since learned
by inform-citimi received directly from BRITZELMAYR that his R. constans is
another species. The name flava was published in 1895 in A. V. LoNNEGREN
Nordisk Svampbok, p. 27.

³⁰ At Vuoitasreita, Vassijokk, Bjo'rkliden, Pessijokk etc. — Probably the
most common species of this genus. Ι do not see any distinct limitation from
R. emetzlca, but only a long series of varieties, all agreeing in the fragile struc-
ture, white stein, gills and spores and acrid taste. — There occur, however,
other varieties with the same structure, but only slightly acrid taste and pale
or subcreamy (not pure white) spore powder. In my notes and herbarium
Ι have proposed ›>subfra9¹ilis›> as a common name for the last named varieties.
among which R. (eriminascenS, mollis and violacea QUEL. probably should be
soughgl' At Vuoitasreita. Vassijokk, Bjorkliden. Pessijokk, Tornetrask and
Piilnoviken. — Under the name yraveolens, published by BRITZELMAYR‚ Ι
mean exat-tly the same plant as that called »Busa olivaeea» in my Obs. Myc„
which includes both R. olivacea and R. xerampelina Auctt. but not R. xeram-
pelina of said Obs. Myc.. which is a quite different plant of smaller size, un-
changing 110311 and no 3111011, rather belonging to the alutacea section but having
a dry and pruinose surface on the pileus. R. xerampelina in the sense of the
authors is in my opinion only a color form or variety of Russula olivacea or
vice versa. The name »oliuacea» is misleading for this species, as the pileus
13 seldom totally olivaceous and often not olivae-eous at all. The name xe-
rampelina is bet-tor, though now blurred by being connected to different plants.
Ι therefore prefer to use the name graveolens, taking it in the broad sense which
was really meant when Ι proposed it, so as to comprise both R. olivacea and
R. xerampelina Auctt. RICKENs R. Linnctei t. 17 fig. l 13 10 my opinion the
same plant. probably also R. alutacea in HERPELL'S Prap. Hutpilze No. 51 and
R. rhytipes SEcR. A form referred to R. pectinata in the mostly unpublished
collection of colored drawings of fungi in the Riksmuseum in Stoekholm
belongs also to this species. — The plant is neither rare nor confined to »pine
woods» as stated in Hym. Eur. In the part of Lappland where I made the
most collections no pin(¹ woods exist, but this Russula was found everywhere,
also above the tree limit.
