possible to make a thorough study of tlie genus Russula, which alone would
have required all the time. Ι must therefore leave several of the collections
out of account for the present. The study of this genus, hard in itself, is ren—
dered still more difficult by the fact that the spores generally change their
color when drying. so that spores which are chalk-white in the fresh state
often become nearly sulphurous or creamy after drying, and so on. This is
the more inconvenient, as the exact spore color is one of the most important
characters for distinguishing the species. It is therefore quite necessary to
collect a sufficient thick layer of spores from the fresh plant and to note the
exact color of that layer before drying. The omission of such a precaution
will often lead to trouble and confusion.

²³ At Katterat, Vassijokk, Bjorkliden. Pessijokk and Tornetrask. -— The
older name ›>heteroplzylla» used in my obs. Myc. is unsuitable for this species,
as the- gills are only seldom ine-qual in length. The younger name »ceruqinem
is not very apt either, as the green color is not properly that of verdigris. In
Lappland the greenish color was almost always quite faded out and substi-
tuted by whitish. at least in specimens growing above the tree limit. QUELET,
who has seen colored drawings of specimens from Stockholm belonging to
this plant, referred it to R. 9raminicolor, R. palumbina and R. mollis, while
BRESADOLA interprets it as R. qrisea PERS. — Though the color varies within
wide limits, Ι never saw it olivaceous as in RICKEN t. 16. fig. 2 (»9raminicolor»)‚
which, if correctly reproduced, probably represents another plant; his t. 18.

fig. l (»9risea») may belong here, but the gills are too dark. — The nearest
allied species is R. cyanooeanffia, which differs especially in having some of the
gills short. Both have creamy (not white) spore powder. —- If the name

»heterophylla» is to be used at all, it should be applied to the species agreeing
with FRIEs' description and well represented by VITT. t. 27 (though the gills
are too broad in fig. 5) and BRES. Fungh. Mang. t. 71. — RICKEN⁷S R. hetero-
phylla, which is said to have ›>blass» spores, can not be the true one, but his
R. cyanoxantha is probably identical with F ROEs’ R. heterophgflla, which has
pure white spore powder. Both R. cyanoscantha and heterophytlla occur in seve-
ral varicties of color. but all varieties of cyanooeantha have creamy spore pow-
der and all varieties of the plant which should be considered as the true R.
heterophylla (R. virescens, in my Obs. Myc.) have chalk-white spore powder.
ln FRIEs' works the synonyms of these two species are confused and R. oeru-
qinea and R. ve8ca are mixed in, and hence the perpetual confusion in nearly
all recent works.

²¹ At Tornetrask (var. rosea and var. qriseolilacz'na). — At present I am
inclined to take this species in a collective sense so as to comprise for instance
R. Pomona, R. Turcz' and allied varieties. The name is well adapted for such
a use. And these allied forms or x-arieties seem to touch or go over into each
other in such a manner that it would be difficult if not impossible in some in-
stances to draw a distinct limit between them. — By the new method of study
inaugurated by Mum: it may be possible sometimes to find distinguishing
differences also between forms or varieties otherwise impossible or very diffi-
cult to separate. and from a pure scient-isio view such a study will apparently
be of great value. But even if in that way there may be afforded sufficient
reason for considering as distinct species two or more varieties, which without
the use of such means must be regarded as belonging to one and the same spe-
cies, 1 think it will be more practical to use a common specific name in such an
instance. and to subordinate to the same as subspecies or varieties those forms
which only by means of chemicals or by a subtile microscopic study of the
spore surface or the like can be demonstrated as really distinct. Else it will
hardly be possible for an ordinary student or botanist to consider at all other
genera than those belonging to his own speciality. With regard to fleshy
fungi and other plants which on account of economic or other value are likely
