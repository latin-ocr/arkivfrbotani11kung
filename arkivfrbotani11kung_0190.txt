to settle the many doubts it seems quite necessary to make a
thorough study of those plants just on the spots from where
the authors obtained the specimens on which the descriptions
are based.

For these reasons I must defer the treatment of Agarica-
ceae to another time and begin with the Polyporaceae, which as
a rule are less destructible so that they can generally be recog-
nized also in the dried state, especially if spores from a fresh
specimen are collected on a glass and saved for comparison.
Such precaution should always be taken, as it is often very diffi—
cult or even impossible to get spores in quantity from dry spe-
cimens, especially if they have been kept dry a considerable
time. And when spores are found only sparingly, they must
be considered doubtful, as spores or sporelike bodies from other
sources or of other nature are often intermixed, a circumstance
that has caused many mistakes and many wrong statements.l

It is well known that one and the same name is often
used for different fungi by different authors, so that the mere
statement of a name will not always be sufficient for identifi-
cation. And the addition of an author's name to the name of
the plant will generally not exclude the ambiguity as even the
sense in which an author used his plant names is often subject
to different opinions, when the descriptions are vague and
authentic specimens are missing or not adapted to remove the
doubts.

And therefore in order to make it possible to see which
plant I mean under the names used, I have found it indispen-
sable in many instances to add some characters. In some in-
stances I have added also photos of the plants or microphotos
of the spores. These microphotos are all taken on the same
scale so as to facilitate comparison. I used a common lens of
HARTNAcK No. 7 with ocular No. 2, the latter at a distance of
35 cm. from the photographic plate and with a camera lens of
GOERZ Ser. III: 1 interposed in close proximity to the ocula-r.
The latter being provided with a scale, the intervals of which
(·orrespond to 3 μ, anyone can control the sizes. The spores
are photographed in diluted solution of sodium—carbonate. The
other photos are all in natural size.

¹ Dried specimens rec-emly collected can give off spores abundantly if
tlne spe-<fimens are moistened by placing on them wet bits of blotting paper or
the like. But after a mouth or two this quality is generally lost.
