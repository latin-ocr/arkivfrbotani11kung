L. ROMELL, HYMENOMYCETES OF LAPPLAND. 31

Of this species which generally has a pink tinge hcre and
there, especially at the margin, there exists a pallid or creamy
variety without 311011 reddish tint. This variety, which 13 rather
frequent at Stockholm both on coniferous and deciduous wood
and which I collected also at Jorn (on a trunk of Pinus silv),
13 found in the east part of Torne Lappmark by C. P. LAESTADws
and 13 mentioned by F RIES in Hym. Eur. p. 575 under Polyp.
nitidus, with which it has nothing to do. BRESADOLA, to whom
I sent specimens of this creamy variety many years ago, referred
it to M er. crispatus. And 30 it 13 named also by SOMMERFELT
in 1113 herbarium. I doubt, however, that it 13 the true JI. cris-
patus F R„ which 13 unknown to me (no authentic specimen
having been saved 30 far as I know). In BLYTT'S herbarium
this sanie variety occurs under the name M er. porinoicles, sug-
gested by BLYTT and approved by FRIES. A specimen 30 named
by FRIES in the Kew herbarium belongs, however, to M.
molluscus.

PERSOON'S Mer. serpens 13 identical with M er. corium F R.
Xylomyzon crustosum PERS. belongs, however, to M. serpens
F R. (The »tubercula sat magna » noted in Myc. Eur. ΙΙ. p.
34 are but peritheoia of a Pyrenomycet on which the M eruli ns
13 growing.)
