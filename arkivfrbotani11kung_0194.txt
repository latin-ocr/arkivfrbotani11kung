P. brumalis.

At Bjorkliden, Nuolja, Palnoviken, Bergfors and Kalixfors.

Pores nearly hexagonal‚ but elongated in radial direction
1—:3 per mm., in tangentia] direction 2¹s2—4 per mm. Spores
allantoid, 2-guttate‚ 5-6 ><2 μ.

Ρ. dichrous, — Fig. 13.

On fallen trunks of Betula at Abisko, Bergfors and Kalix-
fors.

Spores allantoid, 3—4 ¹s2 >< ¹ss2—l μ.

Pol. &pallescens K. is in my opinion not distinct from the
resupinate form of this species.

P. elegans.

fors.

P. euporus. —— Fig. 20 (spores).

On dead trunks of Salia: at Nuolja.

Spores ellipsoidal or ovate, 1-2-guttate, 4-4 ¹s2 (——5)><
2¹s2—3(—3 ¹s'2) μ. Cystidia hyaline, clavate, 15——105 ><6—15

This species is described by KARSTEN‚ and good specimens
of it are distributed in his Fungi Fenn. Exs. No. 618. Of the
three collections so named in KARSTEN’S herbarium two belong
here, the third not. On the other hand his Chaetoporus tenuis
seems to be the same species, and a note on the envelope shows
that KARSTEN himself suspected the identity. QUELET refers
this plant to Pol. nitidus PERs. In PERsoon’s herbarium two
collections of it occur (viZ. No. 910, 277—270 and No. 910, 263—
915), one of which is named ›>P0l. nitidus? Pol. molluscus var.?»
and the other »P0l. molluscus? »‚ showing that PERSOON himself
only with hesitation considered this plant to be identical with
his Pol. nitidus. In FROEs’ herbarium three collections are re-
ferred to Pol. nitidus but none of them belong to Pol. euporus
KARST. I therefore think it best to use KARSTEN’S name, which
is accepted by FRIES.

F RIES confounded this plant with Pol. rimosus K.‚ as his
Pol. Blyttzssz' comprises both. Lured by the fact that both have
