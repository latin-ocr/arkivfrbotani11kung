L. ROMELL, HYMENOMYCETES OF LAPPLAND. 17

Ρ. lapponicus n. sp. —— Fig. 24 (spores).

Pileus reflexus. carnoso-lentus, sordidus, non fissilis, in
statu sicco rigidus, l cm. crassus, supra spumoso- Vel fascicu-
lato-tomentosus. Pori angulati, 3 per mm. Hyphae pilei in-
tricatae, non fibulatae, 4——7 μ latae. Sporae anguste oblongae,
subfusoideae‚ 8—12 ><3—3 ³f4 μ.

On Abies at Nattavara.

Of this plant Ι found a single specimen only, and as Ι sup-
posed it to belong to Pol. borealis, it was not described in fresh
state. This specimen has been fixed along the centre and forms
now an oblong cup of 7 ¹l2 cm. length and 3 Ἃ, cm. breath and
with a dirty or as it were toasted color. It can not be referred
to P. borealis, as the pileus is not fissile and the spores too
slender, the spores of P. borealis· being 5—-7 ><4—4 Ἃ μ.

P. lenis.

On rotten wood of Pinus silvestris at ‹J6rn. -— Though not
collected by me in Lappland. I do not doubt that it will be
found also there.

Pores 3—-4 or 2—5 per mm„ angulate3 partitions thin with
minutely fimbriate margin. Hyphae tough‚ undulate‚ not fibu-
late, 1 {fg—3 μ broad. Spores allantoid, strongly curved so as
to form one half. of a circle, 2-gutta-te‚ 4—4¹s2><l¹s4—l¹s2 μ
(the figures 4—4 ¹f‘2 giving the length of the chord or diameter
and not the actual length of the spore).

My specimens agree so well with the authentic specimens
in KARSTlffl’s herbarium that Ι do not doubt of the identity,
the spores mentioned by KARSTEN being probably not the true
ones.

P. melanopus.

At Bjorkliden.

Pores about 6 per mm. Spores oblong‚ 6¹4³'2—S) ><21«’2-31 '2 μ.

Some of the specimens differ from the form growing at
Stockholm in being bay in the centre and tawny towards the
margin. The pileus is now glabrous but shows under the lens
some remains of a minute felt in the umbilicus. The habit
resembles »Polyporus picipes» from North America which‚ how-
ever, has smaller pores (about 9 per mm.) — The Swedish Pol .
picipes seems to need further exploration on the place where it
