appears rather dubious in this instance. And this not only from
the recedent description in FRIEs’ works but also from the syno-
nyms given by him, especially the citation of Xylomyzon pulch-
ram PERS. Myc. Eur. t. 14. f. 1-2 which does not at all belong
here but is quite identical with Pol. haematodus RosTK. (Polyp.
incarnatus KARST.). On the authority of this citation, the
said Pol. haemcztodus was in fact considered as »M erul. molluscus
FB. ›> by BERKELEY and others, and is so interpreted to this very
day, Ι think, by many English and American mycologists.

Another obstacle is the statement of a variety »pileo bre-
viter reflexo», which I have never seen², and the comparison
with M er. corium, with which my plant has no resemblance.

There exists no authentic specimen of M er. molluscus ΕΒ.
as far as I know. But authentic specimens of M erulius suyacc
FB. both in Upsala and in Christiania seem to be the present
plant. An authentic specimen of M erul. porinoides in Kew is
also identical with it. It should be investigated, however,
what that M aralius porinoides really is which FRIES in a manu-
script still existing states as growing on a certain place at Femsjo
while in the same manuscript he states, that Mer. ‘mella-scus
is frequent at Femsjo. I tried to solve the problem last winter
but could not find any other M erulius on the place cited than
Mer. serpens. The low part of that place was, however, cove-
red with ice and snow and thus was not accessible. Mer. mollus-
cas as here understood I found in Femsjo on two places at least.

The present plant is described by BERKELEY under the
name M er. lacticolor, and a specimen received from The United
States named M er. subamantiacus appears to be the same. —
Merul. (eureus FR. (see my Fungi Exs. No. 119), which is iden-
tical with Xylomyzon croceum PERS„ has some resemblance
also, but is easily distinguished by its thick obtuse (not cob-
webby) margin and by its slender‚ suballantoid spores (4—5 ><
1 ¹52—:2 μ).
