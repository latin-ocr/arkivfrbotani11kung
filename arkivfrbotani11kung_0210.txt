011 bark 01 Abies. Though this species has hitherto been
found only at Umea (by J. VLEUGEL) Ι 1115011 11 11010 because
its occurence also in Lappland proper seems not improbable.

M. himantioides — Fig. 19.

Though Ι did not find this species in Lappland Ι do not
doubt that it occurs there also as it grew abundantly at Laka-
trask and Selsj'on.

Spore powder umber. Spores umber—yellow, ellipsoidal,
s—12 ><5d7 μ. Subiculum at first bombycinous‚ then collap-
sed, 5011000115 and 011011 11010115. Hyphae 5011, collapsing,
fibulate, 2—ss μ broad, 011011 united into threads 01 7—10021,
thickness or more. These threads or fibres 011011 contain
also some hyphae of another kind, viz, turgid (non collapsing)‚
0135110, 11011 1101113110, 3-4 μ 0103(1.

Τ1131 this species is the true M. himantioides of F RIES can
scarcely be doubted, as it agrees well both with his Icon. t. 193.
f. l. and with an authentic specimen in the Kew herbarium.
The wrong placing (in the section »Leptospori ›> instead 01 »007113-
ophorz' ») is a great- obstacle indeed but must be due to oversight
or mistake 01 501110 kind.

The collection from Lakatrask may just as well be referred
to Mer. umbritius, which in fact seems to be the old state 01 M.

What in Germany is called M. silvester must probably also
belong here. In his work »Der Hausschwamm» ΜΕΖ 5001115 10
00 inclined to consider this species as a »wild form ›> 01 M eraclius
lacrymans. In fact there is much analogy between them, and
with regard to the spores the (111101011οο 15 scarcely perceivable.
Nevertheless I think the two are distinct. Not only is M. hi-
mantioicles always comparatively thin, even when it extends half
a meter 01 inore along the trunk, but it is also always totally
resupinate, while M. lacrymans is thick and very often pileate.
The latter species 15 1101 restricted to 11011505. Some years 10-
cently it covered the whole underside of a big fallen trunk 01
Abies· in a wood near Stockholm and formed thick pilei along
the whole margin.

Merul. himantvjoides BRES. Fungi Pol. pag. 83 belongs to
Merul. layclnoz'des HENN. (Hydnum pina-stri FR.) and is quite
distinct from the true 11]. himantioides.
