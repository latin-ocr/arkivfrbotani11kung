Tr. abietis KARST.

On Abies at Nattavara.

Pores 2—4 per mm. Spores hyaline, ellipsoidal-globose,
5—6 ><4—4 ¹ '2 μ.

Ι have met with this species severa-l times also at Stockholm.
VLEUGEL 1135 collected it at Umeel. It is not mentioned in
FROES' works, unless P. chrysoloma is the resupinate form of it,
which seems probable, though it can scarcely be demonstrated

Tr. serialis ΕΒ. - Fig. 25 (spores).

On trunks of Abies at Nattavara.

Pores 3—4 per mm. Spores oblong with oblique basa-l
point. 7—9><3 μ.

Ι have seen this species labelled 35 >>Ροῖ. medulla panis»,

at least.
