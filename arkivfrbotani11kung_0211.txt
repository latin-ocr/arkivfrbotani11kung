M. lepidus 11. 59. — Fig. 16.

Resupinatus, mollis, laxe adhaerens, recens amoene auran-
tius (Re—p. 53, 55, 56) et merulioideo-gibberosus‚ siccus (fere)
laevis et pulchre incarnatus (Sacc. Chrom. 16) vel subtestaceo-
incarnatus (Rep. 63), subiculo albo, molli. Hyphae non fibu-
latae, 3--41ᾖ2 μ latae. Basidia 4-spora, 7—9 μ lata. Sporae
erucaeformes (obovoideo-allantoideo—oblongae), 9—12 ><4—5 μ.

This beautiful species was rare. And rare it is also 31
Stockhohne where I have met with it only once (on fallen bran-
ches of Populus tremula, in April). EGELAND has collected it
at Christiania.

Though habitually very distinct from Cortica'mn incarna-
tum, especially in its fresh state, it· is still perhaps rather allied
to that plant and can easily be placed in the genus Cortice'um
if preferred.

M. molluscus - Fig. 18.

Pinus silv. at Kalixfors.

Spores subhyaline, globoso-ellipsoidaL 5—6 ><4 μ. Basidia

broad.

The color of this species is rather variable, in its fresh
state often orange or about so, with paler margin, but not seldom
ditty yellow (about melleous) or with spots of such dirty color,
in dry state generally melleous or ochraceous, with or without
a tinge of more or less orange. The ›>carneus>› color stated by
F RIES and others and shown in the right part of Icon sel. t. 193.

though the plant is well known 10 me, it being common at 81061(-
holm; but specimens exposed to the light have sometimes a
shade in which a trace of carneus may perhaps be considered
immixed. In the specimens found in Lappland, especially
that from Bjorkliden‚ the delicate cobwebby margin 13 sulphu-

I use here the name »Ma molluscum as understood by
ROB. FmEs, KARSTEN and BRESADOLA, as the illustration above
cited (viz. the left part of it) seems to endorse such interpre-
tation. It must be added, however, that the name question
