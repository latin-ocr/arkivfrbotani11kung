L. ROMELL, HYMENOMYCETES OF LAPPLAND. 15

Ι11 Lappland this species occurs not only in the common
ungulate form but also quite frequently in a more or less resupi-
nate state. — Cf. Pol. laeviqatus, pag. 16.

That this species, at least the ungulate form, is Boletum
iyniarius 01 LINNITJ seems to be beyond a doubt. The plant is
quite common in Lappland as in other parts 01 1110 country,
and me': described it already in his Flora lapponica, though
he there seems to have included also Pol. fomentarius, which
was separated, however, in Flora suecica. (In the second edi-
tion 01 the latter work the description 01 H ydnum imbricatum
has, from wrong imposition, been placed underBoletus iynimius.)
— BOUDIER’S Pol. niqricans (t. 4³8) belongs here, and the form
on Betula is KARSTEN⁷S Pol. niqrzfcasns. Also FRIES' original
Pol. niqrz'cans in Syst. Myc. I p. 375 is the Betula-form 01 Polyp.
12'9m'amssus (›>Ad truncos Bestiam, nec alibi »). I have myself
collected it at Femsjo, Stockholm, Upsala eto„ and it is quite
identical with the lapponian plant. Though the specimens
on Βρύαῖα, 31 least 01 1110 ungulate form, seem often to have a
trifle larger spores than those on Saliae, I should not consider
it convenient to separate them as a distinct species as it seems
to be quite impossible to trace any constant (111101011οο 111 011101
respects. — The Klotzschian plant from Scotland cited by
FRIES in Hym. Eur. pag. 558 is. according to the specimen in
Berlin, only the old, blackened state 01 Polyp. sementaria-5,
which has nothing to do with Pol. vssqm'arius.

P. lacteus.

On rotten log 01 Betula at Bjorkliden.

Pileus under the lens roughly or reticularly tomentose at
least behind, towards the margin more evenly pubescent, at
last becoming glabrous. Spores allantoid‚ 31].2-5><ΙὟ2 μ,
Hyphae intricate, very ramose, 3—9 μ broad.

This species seems to be identical with one known in Ame-
rica as Polyporus ahionem. VVhether P. ebionem 01 FRIES is
really the same plant I do not know. My specimens agree
with the authentic Pol. lacteus at Kew. In FRIES' herbarium
neither P. lacteus nor P. chionen& is represented by authentic
specimens, as far as I know. There is, however, a collection from

hymenial spines but the form and size and color etc. of the plant which distin—
guishes Polyp. pomacezcs PERS. from Pol. {quim-ius.
