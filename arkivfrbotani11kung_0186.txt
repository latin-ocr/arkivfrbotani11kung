about eleven of Lactarius (quciosmusss, luteusw, paludinellusffi,
repraesentaneus¹⁴‚ rusa-3¹⁵, subdulcisffl, theioqalusff, torminosusss,
triviali-3¹⁹, uvidusffl, vietus-2¹), and about seventeen of Russula22

slightly rough spores but also a-pale variety with strongly echinulate spores
resembling those of Laccarz'a tortilis BOUD. Icon. myc. I. t. 59.

¹¹ At VassitjokkO, Bjo'rkliden, Nuolja, Abisko, Stordalen, Pessijokk. —
At. Tornetrask station Ι found a dark variety with only a faint or (in some
specimens) even no smell. This variety has been collected several times also
at Stockholm, and has always puzzled me as not agreeing exactly with any
of the species described. As it seems to be well distinct from the typical form,
it may be regarded as a proper species. Before establishing a new name,
however, we must clear up its relation to L. mammosus FR. with which it may
have some alliance, though differing strongly from FRIES’ Ic. t. 170. In
BLYTT and ROSTRUP, Norges Hymenomyceter‚ pag. 98 is described a var.
frayilis, which seems to be allied too. Cf. also Lactaria Hibbardae in BUR-
ΜΝΘΗΑΜ, Lact. of United States. Δ

¹² Of this species, which is described in BLYTT and ROSTRUR Norges
Hymenomyceter. pag. 93. Ι saw but one little specimen (at the railway station
Kopparasen in 1910). And as Ι forgot to describe it in the fresh state, Ι arn
not quite sure of its identity with the Norwegian plant. It had about the
aspect of a small Russula lutea, just as stated by BLYTT, but my dried specimen,
which is 14 mm. broad and 15 mm. high, shows under the lens some asperity
at or near the margin. which is not stated by BLYTT and which seems to indi-
cate some alliance with L. repraesentamus. It grew at the side of a fallen trunk
of Betula and adhered to the trunk when the latter was turned over, but pro-
bably it had its mycelium in the ground and not in the trunk.

¹³ With some hesitation I refer to this species, described by PECK, some
δρθρΙιῐῖῗηὸίοῗξίἰπξὲἒὲἓε,δῐξέῐζῐιιῗέὶαὴγηγ ἙΒΙΙΞΣΙΞᾘῙΞΙΞΙΕ, Ι found some few specimens
at Pessijokk and Tornetr‘ask station. From L. scrobiculatus‚ to which FRIES
referred it as a variety, it is sufficiently distinct both by its mild or slightly
bitter (not. acrid) taste and by turning lilac where handled or injured. Whe-
ther really distinct from Lactaria speciosa BURL. seems doubtful. At all
events Ι would prefer, however, to use this name, which is much better than
the older one.

¹⁵ At Katterat, Vassijokk, Pessijokk, Tornetrask and. Kalixfors.

¹⁸ At Bjo'rkliden, Pessijokk and Tornetrask. — On Vuotasreita Ι saw
a form with brighter color. which might be referred to L. mitissimus.

¹⁷ Noted only at Bjijrkliden. —— Having not seen this plant before, Ι first
suspected L. mitissimus. to which it has great resemblance, but from which
it is instantly distinguished when injured, the juice turning sulphurous.

¹⁸ Noted at Vassijokk, Bjorkliden‚ Stordalen, Pessijokk, Tometr'ask and
Palnoviken.

¹⁹ At Tornctr'ask and Kalixfors. — At Tornetrask Ι found also specimens
with only slightly acrid taste. and at Nuolja I collected a variety with quite‘
mild taste. Perhaps a distinct species.

²⁰ At Vassijokk and Palnoviken. — Near Vassijokk on the east side, not
far south from the railway, Ι found a variety of about the same color as the
type and also turning lilac when touched or cut, but having a decided smell
of Η urnulas both in the fresh and dried state. — At Stordalen among Salices
Ι met with a specimen with clay-yellowish color which perhaps might be
referred to L. aspicieus, though the taste was mild. As, however, I do not
know L. aspidem from its original growing place, the question can not be
settled at present.

²¹¹ This species was thr² most coininon; it grew abundantly not only on the
ground but also on rotten trunks. Though Ι have noted it only from Bjork-
liden. Pessijokk. Tornetriisk and Pzilnoviken, it no doubt occurs throughout
the whole birch region.
