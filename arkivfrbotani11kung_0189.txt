L . ROMELL, HYMENOMYCETES OF LAPPLAND. A

Ι am not ready at present to give a complete list of all the
species collected. My knowledge of many species of C'ortimlrieas
and other difficult genera and of their relation to thc names and
descriptions already published is still very incomplete. In order

Ι now consider it distinct. though Ι have met with forms which appeared diffi—
cult to separate. The plant is quite common in Sweden, and FRIES probably
referred it to another name. as he does not give R. Queletz'i as a Swedish species.
That it nevertheless was this plant which QUELET sent to FRIES and which
FRIES named »R Qaeletia'» seems to be beyond a doubt, as Quelet himself has
so determined a set of colored drawings made from Swedish specimens.

³⁶ At Tornetrask. ——- As Ι understand this species it is closely allied to
R. sanquinea. The stem is, however, white, the color of the pileus more diluted
and the gills are not decurrent. I have collected it only among leafy trees
and not »in pinastretis ». -—- There occurs, however, a rosy or incarnate species
which has sometimes much resemblance to R. rosacea, but is quite distinct
from it by its pure white spore powder and by the fact that its stem and gills
(which are often decurrent) stain chrome-yellow where injured. This species
grows also among leafy trees, but is rare and seems to be overlooked by FR1ES.
though it has been found (by BURT) also at Femsjo. Ι have called it R. ro-
sella in my notes. It seems to be allied to BRESADOLA⁷s R. sardonia Fung.
Trid. t. 94, which differs, however, by its reddish stem.

³7 At Riksgr‘ansen. Vassijokk‚ Bjorkliden‚ Mjellejokk and Kalixfors. ——

³⁸ At Bj o'rkliden. — As Ι understand this species, it comprises both t. 981
(1019) and t. 982 (lo-20) of COOKE⁷s Illustr.‚ the grade of decurrence of the gills
varying with age and other conditions within wide limits even in one and the
same group of specimens. The spore powder is creamy. — As a contribution
to the commenta-ries on the dubious R. Linnaez', I hope H. VON Posm* whose
drawing of it was approved by FRIES . will not take amiss my stating that
he once referred to R. Linnaei and even with the addition of the affirmative
sign Μ» a long-stemmed specimen of this same R. sanquinea. though he ad-
mitted the possibility of a mist-ake when I called his attention to the taste.
In fact FRIEs’ description of R. Linnaec' agrees pretty well to R. sanguinea, if
we omit the taste.

³⁹ At Palnoviken. Pessijokk. Tornetra'sk. Bergfors and Kalixfors. ——In
my Obs. Myc. this plant is mentioned as a forma obscura of R. decolorans. The
name »vinosa » is more significant and has priority. as LINDBLAD had pre-
viously used it many years and given it a certain publicity by his exhibitions
of fimgi. As far as Ι know, it was not, however. published in print before
the issue of his Svampbok (1901).

* Since this note was written. Ι have received the news that my noble and
highly esteemed leader and friend. the honorable polymathist, Professor Doetor
Hampus von Post. died at Upsala August lssth. nearly 89 years of age (having
been born Dec. l5th, 1822). His long life was a continuous and assiduous
study. While his geological researches are probably those most appreciated,
he spent considerable time upon the study of arachnida and upon nearly all
branches of botany also, viz. phytogeography‚ ecology, phenology, pathology
etc.. and Ι think that nobody knew better than he the fungi growing in the
neighbourhood of Upsala. where he every year made frequent excursions
and deposited his observations in detailed notes illustrated by colored draw-
ings of his own hand. During my residence as a student at the University
of Upsala and also later after my removal to Stockholm‚ I often resorted to
his accumulated experience and valuable knowledge in mycological matters:
and though he was not always able to remove all my doubts, he always did his
best and neve-r refused to deal wit-h my troubles. Ι beg to express here my
deep gratitudo for all the kindness and all the valuable information bestowed
upon me by this venerable mycological Nestor.
