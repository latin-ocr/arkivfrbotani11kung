Pol . smnosus, boloniensis, salimus and manicas as far as authen-
tic specimens in the Kew herbarium are concerned.

It has been found, on the hymenium of Pol. fomentarius
also at Ratan near Umea by VLEUGEL, who in Svensk Bot.
Tidskrift 1908 Bd 2 H. 3 p. 309 mentions it under Pol. vulqaris,
with forms of which it really has great resemblance. — A spe-
cimen collected at Bygget in Halland by LLOYD and marked
09262 may also belong to this species.

A form of what Ι suppose to be the same plant but growing
on Saline at· Nuolja was repeatedly found attacked by a dark
parasitic fungus with 5—10 μ broad branchecl hyphae which
rendered the hymenium more or less dirty or discolored (fus-
cous, reddish, olivaceous etc.). The specimen found on Pinus
silvestris at Kalixfors was also contaminated by this parasite.

P. pannocinctus n. sp. — Fig. 8.

Resupinatus‚ adnatus, albidus, cum subiculo distincto,
molli circ. 1 mm. 01333113, margine albo, pannoso, adpresso,
circ. 2-—3 mm. lato cinctus. Hymenium subcremeum, tinctura
levissima luteovirente (Rep. lO 4 311), saltem in statu sicco, a
subiculo linea tenui subcornea limitatum. Pori glabri, minuti,
6—-7 or 5—7 per mm. Hyphae molles, 1—41s2(—6) μ latae,
ramosae, fibulato-septatae, saepe collapsae. Sporae, hyalinae
allantoideae‚ 3——4 ¹s2><¹l2(—l) μ.

011 rotten wood of Betala at Kalixfors.

As the pore-partitions at last become very thin and pellucid
one might suspect this plant to be Pol. vitreus. It is, however,
not Pol. vitreus PERs.‚ as far as can be judged from the poor
fragments still existing in PERSOON'S herbarium, nor Pol. vi-
treus of KARSTEN (which seems to be identical with his P. pal-
lescen& pr. p.) nor that of BRESADOLA (which looks like a form
of Pol. vulqaris). What FRffls referred to P. vitreus, it seems
now impossible to decide, since no authentic specimen exists
as far as I know.

P. perennis.

At Tornotrask station. Only a little. young specimen
with the hymenium undeveloped.
