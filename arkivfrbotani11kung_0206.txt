tinet as it is much thicker and has pores more than twice as
large and consequently a different habit, and as no intermediate
connecting forms exist as far as I know.¹ Of Tram. moltis,
which is a rather common plant at Stockholm‚ I did not find
a single specimen in Lappland. The statement in Hym. Eur.
p. 585 that Tram. mollis is »in zona arctica vulgaris» might per-
haps be owing to some confusion with Pol. stercoides.

Pol. stereoides being a very rare plant in other parts of
Sweden (I never saw it but in Lappland) FRIES probably found
it but once. It is thus no wonder that he later forgot the habit
and characters of it and confounded it with specimens of the
allied Trametes mollis. That his idea of Pol. stereoides was
not clear in his later age appears also from the fact that he did
not recognize the specimen of this plant sent from BLYTT and
mentioned in Hym. Eur. under P. macraulos.

As synonyms, may be added: Pol. Epilobzfi KARST. Pol.

P. tenuis KARST.

On fallen trunks of Pinus silvestris at Kalixfors.

Pores 2-—5 per mm. Spores hyaline, linear-oblong or
allantoid but only slightly curved, 7—9><l¹„x'2 μ, 2-guttate.
Spines brown, subulate, 40—60 ><6 μ. Hyphae 2—3 μ broad.

That this plant belongs to Fomes· tenuis K. (Poria contiqua
KARST.)‚ which is common at Stockholm on rotten wood of
Abies, is out of doubt. But whether Fomes tenuis K. is a syno-
nym of Boletus contiquus PERS. is a question still unsettled to me.
PERSOON’S plant is certainly closely allied (the hymenial spines
measuring 30—60—130 ><6—12 μ) but the speres are unknown
and not a single specimen in my rich collections agrees e xactly
with PERSOON'S specimens with regard to the villosity on the
surface of pileus. —— Pol. contiquus of FRIEs is quite different.
according to the authentic specimens in his herbarium two of:
which belong to Pol. saliemus, while the third is identical with
Pol. punctatim· (Porz'a Friesicma BRES.).
